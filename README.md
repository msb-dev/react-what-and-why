## Task

See if you can implement task deletion!

Hint:

- Create a `deleteTask` function that can remove a task from the `tasks` array by ID
- Pass that in as a prop to `TaskList` and then into each `Task`
- In `Task`, add a handler to the delete button's `onChange` that calls `deleteTask` with the right ID
