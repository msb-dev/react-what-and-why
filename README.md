## Task

- Lift up state from `TaskList` to `App` and pass the state down to `TaskList` as a prop
- Switch the task counts from being hard-coded to being passed in to `TasksSummary` as props
- Pass in the total count as `tasks.length`
- Define a function to calculate the completed count from the tasks array

The finished code for the above is here: https://stackblitz.com/github/msb-dev/react-what-and-why/tree/07-lifting-state-up.
