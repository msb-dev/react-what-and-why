## Task

- Lift up state from TaskList to App and pass the state down to TaskList as a prop

Follow along as we

- switch the task counts from being hard-coded to being passed in to TasksSummary as props
- pass in the total count as `tasks.length`
- declare a function to calculate the completed task count. Implementation is a task in the next exercise...

The finished code for the above is here: https://stackblitz.com/github/msb-dev/react-what-and-why-06b.
